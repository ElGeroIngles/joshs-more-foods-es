# Josh's More Foods
I noticed a lack of newer food datapacks that add a large amount of extra foods, so I went about making my own with the help of some friends.

There are currently a bit over 20 recipes added by this pack, with a lot more coming in the future.

## Disclaimer
This datapack is incompatible with other packs or mods that unlock all recipes, as the crafting system relies on learning new recipes.

Some items in this datapack don't stack (despite crafting yielding more than 1 sometimes). I recommend the use of plugins or mods that allow for beetroot stew and rabbit stew to stack (ideally to 16) if you want your food stash to be a bit more compact.

Make sure to properly uninstall versions of the datapack before v3.0 in order to clear old traces.

## Installing
Open the latest version in the releases tab on the right. Download the resource pack and place it in your `resourcepacks` folder, then download the datapack and place it in the `datapacks` folder of your world or server.

## Recipes and Information
To view this datapack's recipes and other information in-game, you can craft a recipe book using bread and a book and quill.

You can also refer to the [wiki](https://github.com/Joshcraft2002/joshs-more-foods/wiki).

You may need to craft a new book depending on updates (refer to the changelog for more information)

## Uninstalling
To uninstall the datapack, run this command: `/function joshmats:morefoods/uninstall`

Afterwards, you can safely remove the file from your datapack folder.
